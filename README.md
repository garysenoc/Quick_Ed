2. Move the QuickEd folder in the htdocs inside the XAMPP
3. Install the SMS Gateway Me ( It will be needed for the teacher's side in order to send SMS to the students using only their load unlike using other APIs which are very more costly which amounting from 0.80 to 1 peso every SMS)
4. Configure the SMS Gateway ME  to connect your phone.

We maximize the use of SMS in order to give easy access to the students to their grades and important announcements from school without the means of having an internet connection which are not every student can afford to have and there's some places where signals are not that very strong to make an internet connection.
